# soft_robot_shape_estiamtion
Soft robots have infinite degrees of freedom and can perform many tasks in unstructured and complex environments that hard robots find impossible. However, the entire shape perception of soft robots has been challenging. This study proposes a multi-scale supervised Variational Auto-Encoder (SVAE) that can predict the overall shape of a soft body robot in real-time(<10ms/frame), including the degree of bending and local deformation, based on optical waveguide sensor signals. According to the experiment results, the mean of intersection over union (IOU) metric between the shape of the soft robot predicted by the algorithm and the body of the actual soft robot is 0.917. The form of the soft robot can be accurately predicted even in the presence of external objects obstructing the soft robot's motion (mean of IOU = 0.893). !
